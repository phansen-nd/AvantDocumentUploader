To do:

To done:
-Login/Signup
-manually do constraints to set up for all screen sizes
-set Document ACL to current user as well as public read access (once Login is setup)
-save photo before saving the rest of the object to save some time
-App Icon
-make ScrollView autosize to fill bottom of screen
-figure out when to reload images (don't reload ones we already have)
-Make single photo viewer

Future work:
-more robust network connection handling


Notable features:
-Resizes thumbnails depending on device. Very usefully big on iPad.
-Saves images as soon as their taken and later links them to Document objects. This saves a lot of time in saving a Document. It's deceptively quick. The tradeoff is more network traffic.
